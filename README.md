Ultimate Pong
=============

A pong clone with multiplayer written with C++11.

Ultimate Pong isn't just any pong clone. It will feature fairly funny easter eggs and trolls, paddles that have a mind of their own, and a multiplayer mode which supports all of this.

All this sounds great, Luke, where can I get the game?
------------------------------------------------------
Well, you see my friend, I haven't finished it yet, though simple (, un-ultimate) pong-like gameplay is coming soon once I get an alpha version out. Soon, it's coming soon...

What was your inspiration, Luke, when coming up with this game? Why did you add these specific features?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, you see my friend, Ultimate Pong was born from a joke, it was one, it is one, and it always will be remembered as one, for that reason I don't plan on this becoming anything significant. The fact that you are reading this FAQ amazes me! Thank you...

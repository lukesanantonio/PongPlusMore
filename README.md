Pong Plus More (PpM)
====================

A pong clone full of surprises written with C++11

Pong Plus More isn't just any pong clone. It will feature fairly funny easter
eggs and trolls, paddles that have a mind of their own, and a multiplayer mode
which supports all of this. It is released under the GPL so you'll be able to
play PpM for free, though I haven't got an alpha out yet, so you'll just have
to wait... Thanks for your interest! I am *sort of* managing the development
with Trello, you can find my board, in all its glory, [here][1]. I can't
imagine it very interesting, but it should soon be a solid snapshot of my
progress thus far, though there are no guarantees! =D

Planned Features
----------------

I hope Pong Plus More could someday be the go-to pong game for everyone! I plan
to add:

 - Javascript scripting to control arbitrary paddles and a "Level Editor" to go
 with that!
   - The maps and scripts can be bundled into a package and distributed as a
   gamemode.
 - Complete Network Transparency. The scripting API will do the best job it can
 in allowing the developer to avoid special cases involved when a player
 abstraction isn't that great...
 - Configurable. It'd be nice if a player could change the resolution of their
 pong game. So why not!
 - Some other stuff that I can't remember at the moment.

FAQ
---

#### Why Pong Luke? It's Pong! Who cares about Pong!
This game is basically a learning experience. If I happen to make a great game
in the process, then great!

#### Why is the trello page so out of date
You mean [this one][1]? Yeah, it's pretty bad now, but I am working on
organizing it! Just sit tight and check back every so often...

#### Luke, you've been working on this game since March, what's taking so long?
I don't know, I am getting a bit too worried over design that I barely make any
progress... However, recently I have been able to code and produce fairly
alright code.

Also I have set an unofficial deadline of March 4th, 2014 for an
early alpha. An early alpha will include multiplayer support with flying
paddles, at the least.

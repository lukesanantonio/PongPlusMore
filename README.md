Pong Plus More (PpM)
=============

A pong clone full of surprises written with C++11

Pong Plus More isn't just any pong clone. It will feature fairly funny easter
eggs and trolls, paddles that have a mind of their own, and a multiplayer mode
which supports all of this. It is released under the GPL so you'll be able to
play PpM for free, though I haven't got a alpha out yet, so you'll just have to
wait... Thanks for your interest!
